# DGMM-Sine-Gordon
Discrete Gradient Moving Mesh solver for the 1D Sine-Gordon equation

Recommended packages/tools:

None.

This code is meant as a supplement to [1] , and is an implementation of a moving mesh energy preserving solver using the Average Vector Field (AVF) discrete gradient. Please refer to [1] if this code is used in a project.

To get started, open the demo.m file and read the commented code there.

This is the first release, so if you have comments and suggestions for improvements, please contact me and I will try to accommodate them.
